A Kubernetes cluster can be created on your laptop, VM, cloud provider or a rack of bare metal servers. For development purposes, it's easiest to start with a one-node cluster using https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube[Minikube]. Hosted solutions or cloud-based solutions provide the scalability and higher availability for production purposes. A complete list of solutions to create a Kubernetes cluster is explained at http://kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides/.

This section will explain how to create and shutdown a development Kubernetes cluster using Minikube. The next section will show how to create a highly available cluster on AWS using https://github.com/kubernetes/kops[Kops], as explained in the link:../cluster-install[cluster install] section.

== Download and Install

Minikube runs a single-node Kubernetes cluster inside a VM on your laptop. This allows users to easily try out Kubernetes on your local machine. Minikube packages and configures a Linux VM, the container runtime, and all Kubernetes components, optimized for local development.

Complete installation instructions are available at https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube. Here are quick instructions:

=== Setup on macOS

Provision and install a local Kubernetes cluster on a Mac OS via https://brew.sh/[homebrew].

. Install VirtualBox

    brew cask install virtualbox

. Either install minikube or update your existing minikube installation

.. Installing minikube
    brew cask install minikube
Verify the version:
+
    $ minikube version
    minikube version: v0.23.0
+
.. Updating an existing minikube installation
    brew cask reinstall minikube
+
If you receive this error after `brew cask install minikube`:
+
    ==> Installing Cask minikube
    Error: It seems there is already a Binary at '/usr/local/bin/minikube'; not linking.
+
Run this command:
+
    $ sudo cp ~/Library/Caches/Homebrew/Cask/minikube--0.23.0 /usr/local/bin/minikube
+

Finally delete the previous minikube ISO:
+
    minikube delete
+
. Install Kubectl CLI

    brew install kubernetes-cli
+
If you already have Kubectl CLI installed, then you just need to update it:
+
    brew upgrade kubernetes-cli

=== Setup on Windows

. Download and install https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads[VirtualBox].
. Download the https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/latest/minikube-windows-amd64.exe[minikube-windows-amd64.exe] file, and rename it to `minikube.exe`.
+
Verify the version:
+
    $ minikube version
    minikube version: v0.23.0
+
. Download kubectl CLI:
+
    curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/$(curl -s https://storage.goo \
    gleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/stable.txt)/bin/windows/amd64/kubectl.exe

Latest instructions are also available at https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/#before-you-begin.

=== Setup on Linux

. Download and install https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads[VirtualBox].
. Install minikube:
+
    curl -Lo minikube https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/latest/minikube-linux-amd64 && chmod +x minikube && sudo mv minikube /usr/local/bin/
+
Verify the version:
+
    $ minikube version
    minikube version: v0.23.0
+
. Install or Upgrade Kubectl CLI:
+
    curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/$(curl -s https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/stable.txt)/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl
    chmod +x kubectl && sudo mv kubectl /usr/local/bin/


=== Setup on EC2 (if you do not virtualbox on your laptop)

. Launch an EC2 (at least 4GB Memory) with an "Ubuntu Server 16.04 LTS (HVM)" AMI, make sure you have a public IP and can SSH into this instance.
. SSH into the EC2 (the port forwarding is for the minikube dashboard):
+
    ssh -L30000:localhost:30000 ubuntu@<IP Address of EC2>
+

. Install docker
+
    sudo -i
    apt-get update -y &&  apt-get install -y docker.io
+

. Install minikube:
+
    curl -Lo minikube https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/latest/minikube-linux-amd64 && chmod +x minikube && sudo mv minikube /usr/local/bin/
+

Verify the version:
+
    $ minikube version
    minikube version: v0.23.0
+
. Install or Upgrade Kubectl CLI:
+
    curl -Lo kubectl https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/v1.8.0/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl && chmod +x kubectl && sudo mv kubectl /usr/local/bin/
+

. Add kubectl autocompletion to your current shell
+
    source <(kubectl completion bash)

== Start Kubernetes cluster

We are using the VirtualBox driver which is the default selection for minikube. If you would prefer you can use an alternate supported component (xhyve driver or VMware Fusion) using the `--vm-driver=xxx` flag.

Start a single-node Kubernetes cluster on your local machine:

```
    minikube start
```

if you have installed minikube on a EC2, start it with the --vm-driver=none flag

```
    minikube start --vm-driver=none
```

The first start of minikube will download the ISO file and then start the cluster. It shows the following output:

```
$ minikube start
Starting local Kubernetes v1.8.0 cluster...
Starting VM...
Downloading Minikube ISO
 140.01 MB / 140.01 MB [============================================] 100.00% 0s
Getting VM IP address...
Moving files into cluster...
Downloading localkube binary
 148.56 MB / 148.56 MB [============================================] 100.00% 0s
Setting up certs...
Connecting to cluster...
Setting up kubeconfig...
Starting cluster components...
Kubectl is now configured to use the cluster.
```

Now you can start to develop and test your application.

=== Check status

Check the status of minikube to get the status of your local Kubernetes cluster:

```
$ minikube status
minikube: Running
cluster: Running
kubectl: Correctly Configured: pointing to minikube-vm at 192.168.99.100
```

Kubectl CLI is configured to talk to this cluster.

== Kubernetes basic commands

Now that we have a local cluster up and running we can start issuing some basic commands and deploy some simple resources.

In this part we will familiarize ourselves with the `kubectl` CLI tool and basic Kubernetes commands. We will first deploy a basic NGINX pod and execute some commands to help developers gain comfort with the Kubernetes environment from an end-user perspective. This helps get developers up and running taking advantage of the Kubernetes application deployment capabilities without having to worry about the infrastructure related complexities.

NOTE: The kubectl commands below will be routed via your virtualbox network interface. If you are using a VPN or have a local firewall, this may prevent kubectl from contacting the minikube endpoint. Stopping the VPN or adding a firewall rule may resolve this.

=== Display nodes

This command will show all the nodes available in your kubernetes cluster:

    kubectl get nodes

It shows the output as:

  NAME       STATUS    ROLES     AGE       VERSION
  minikube   Ready     <none>    46m       v1.8.0

=== Create your first pod

This command creates an nginx pod into your cluster:

    kubectl run nginx --image=nginx

Get the list of deployments:

    $ kubectl get deployments
    NAME      DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
    nginx     1         1         1            0           41s

Get the list of running pods:

    $ kubectl get pods
    NAME                     READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    nginx-4217019353-h7mns   1/1       Running   0          1m

Get additional details for the pod by using the `<pod-name>` from the above output:

```
$ kubectl describe pod/nginx-4217019353-h7mns
Name:           nginx-4217019353-h7mns

```

By default, pods are created in a `default` namespace. In addition, a `kube-system` namespace is also reserved for Kubernetes system pods. A list of all the pods in `kube-system` namespace can be displayed as shown:

```
$ kubectl get pods --namespace kube-system
NAME                          READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
kube-addon-manager-minikube   1/1       Running   0          1m
kube-dns-1326421443-69xs9     3/3       Running   0          1m
kubernetes-dashboard-5jt9q    1/1       Running   0          1m
```

=== Get logs from the pod

Logs from the pod can be obtained (a fresh nginx does not have logs - check again later once you have accessed the service):

    kubectl logs <pod-name>

=== Execute a shell on the running pod

This command will open a TTY to a shell in your pod:

    kubectl get pods
    kubectl exec -it <pod-name> /bin/bash

This opens a Bash shell and allows you to look around the filesystem of the container.

=== Expose pod

By default, all Kubernetes resources are only accessible within the cluster. This command will publish the NGINX pod to a port on the host where its deployed:

    kubectl expose pod <pod-name> --port=80 --type=NodePort --name=web

Where `<pod-name>` is the pod name of your NGINX pod. This will expose the pod as a Service. You can see the published service:

    $ kubectl get svc
    NAME         TYPE        CLUSTER-IP   EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)        AGE
    kubernetes   ClusterIP   10.0.0.1     <none>        443/TCP        50m
    web          NodePort    10.0.0.138   <none>        80:32406/TCP   3s

=== View service webpage

This minikube command will display the service for you in a web page:

    minikube service web

This opened a browser with an IP address and the port that the service was exposed on. It looks like as shown:

image::nginx-welcome-page.png[]

This is a convenient feature of minikube. But what if you wanted to find this information yourself?

You can view the IP address of a node in your cluster with these steps, first find all of the nodes in your cluster:

    kubectl get nodes

Once you have the nodes (in minikubes case there will be only one), we can describe all of the attribute of that node with:

    kubectl describe node <node-name>

Where `<node-name>` is the output from the previous command. This shows a lot of information about the node:

```
$ kubectl describe node minikube
Name:               minikube
Roles:              <none>

```

IP address information can be obtained by looking at the `InternalIP` field:

    $ echo $(kubectl get nodes -o jsonpath='{.items[*].status.addresses[?(@.type=="InternalIP")].address}')

This gives us the IP address where the service is hosted. Now, we need to get the port that the service is exposed on. This can be found using the following command:

    $ echo $(kubectl get service web -o jsonpath='{.spec.ports[*].nodePort}')

We can combine these two commands with curl to access the service from the cli:
```
$ curl $(kubectl get nodes -o jsonpath='{.items[*].status.addresses[?(@.type=="InternalIP")].address}'):$(kubectl get service web -o jsonpath='{.spec.ports[*].nodePort}')
```

The host and the port are the exact same values where minikube opened the service page in the browser.

=== Kubernetes dashboard

Kubernetes dashboard is a general purpose, web-based UI for Kubernetes clusters. It provides an overview of applications running on the cluster, as well as the ability to create or modify individual Kubernetes resources and workloads, such as replica sets, jobs, services, and pods. The dashboard can be used to manage the cluster as well.

Kubernetes dashboard with minikube can be easily viewed using the following command ( Do not run this if you have minikube on EC2, instead just point your browser to http://127.0.0.1:30000):

    minikube dashboard

It looks like this:

image::minikube-dashboard.png[]

Look around the dashboard and become familiar with some of the Kubernetes terminology. This will be explained in the subsequent chapters.


=== Delete resources

Delete the Kubernetes resources created so far:

    kubectl delete svc/web deployment/nginx


=== Shutdown cluster

The cluster can be shutdown using the following command:

    $ minikube stop
    Stopping local Kubernetes cluster...
    Machine stopped.

== Create a multi-node cluster on AWS

Though some of the exercises that follow would work on Minikube, let's create a multi-node Kubernetes cluster on AWS as explained in link:../cluster-install[Install Kubernetes cluster using Kops].
